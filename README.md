# Subdomain Providers

A curated list of subdomain providers, offering free and paid subdomains for website hosting, dynamic DNS, and other services.

## What is a Subdomain?

A subdomain is a part of a larger domain name. For example, `blog.example.com` is a subdomain of `example.com`.  Subdomains can be used to organize different sections of a website, host separate applications, or provide unique addresses for specific services.

## Types of Subdomain Services

This list includes various types of subdomain services:

* **Website Hosting:** Providers that allow you to host your website on a subdomain.
* **Dynamic DNS:** Services that update your subdomain's DNS records automatically, allowing you to access devices on a dynamic IP address (useful for home servers, security cameras, etc.).
* **Other Services:**  Providers offering subdomains for other purposes, such as URL shortening or specific application hosting.
